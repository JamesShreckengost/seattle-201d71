# Problem Domain

The Seattle Kitten Rescue Service, tons of kittens that need homes. They meed a web site that can match perspective owner with rescue. They have hundreds of kittens, they want a place for users to find kittens and get info about those kittens and make descisions based on information that the SKR has.

## What Features do we need?

- As a person who wants to adopt, I would like a profile of kittens that SKR has rescued.
  - personality traits
  - name
  - breed
  - image of the cat
  - health history
- As the Rescue Service
  - Who is adopting
    - Name
    - age
    - pet history ( as a pet owner )
    - Address

Out of Scope
- removing kittens from a list
- social media
- no videos

## Specific Tasks to complete
 - Displaying a list of cats that need adopting
 - Create a form for adding cats to our list
 - Create a form for perspective cat owners
