# Class 01: Course Mechanics

## Canvas

- Learning journals due by midnight, maybe hard locking
- Calendar view for a broad overview of when things are due.

## Readings / Reading Notes

- Everyday, there will readings due before class Lecture begins.
- Some we want you to read entirely, others we want you to skim.
  - Each reading will have an entry into our reading notes repo.
  - See video / jacobKnaack/reading-notes on github
- How to make visible to the world:
  - 1) Activate github pages
    - got to settings
    - scroll to `Github Pages`
    - Select a branch to publish and hit save.
  - 2) Add A new file to link to in you root level README.md
      - Link should include text to display and a URL to the new page to navigate to
        - [Text](/path/to/file.md)

## VS Code

## Command Line Tools

- `pwd` : print working direcory

## Git / Github

- Git is software that is installed on your computer / github is a website that stores filed remotely.
- Some git commands I've mentioned
  - `git clone`: takes all the code in a REMOTE repository and copies to your LOCAL machine.
    - Creates a new directory names whatever the repo was named.
  - `git pull`: Give my local machine all the changes (all the files and edits) that exist on the REMOTE.
  - `git add .`: Adds all files in the current directory location, so that git can track those changes. 
    - This only works when all the files and folders are in your current working directory.
  - `git commit -m 'message to attach to saved changes'`: I want to save these changes locally, think of this as a checkpoint for your work.
  - `git push origin <branch-name>`: I want to save these changes remotely, think of this as copying your local changes to the cloud.
